## üß† Problem Statement

The telecom sector is a high-value target for cyber attacks, espionage, and data breaches. Manual monitoring cannot keep pace with the dynamic threat landscape. This tool uses GenAI to automate the process of identifying irregularities in telecom data flow and generates threat alerts in real-time.

## üõ°Ô∏è Objectives

- Detect **irregular packet behavior**, DNS abuse, or **unauthorized access**.
- Provide **real-time threat alerts** in a user-friendly dashboard.
- Identify **HTTP-based insecure connections** and **login leaks**.
- Enable automated **report generation** and **log archiving**.
- Integrate with **Wireshark**, **GPT-2**, and **open threat intel feeds**.
